In this app , we created flashcard to help the user to study hystory . The app is devided by three screen : the main screen in wich a welcome message is readable and prompt the user to start the quiz, a second screen where the user can start the quiz , and a third screen where he can review the questions and see his score. 
In the main screen , the user can see a welcoming message: "Welcome to history quiz, click on start to begin the quiz , you will be asked 5 questions about history , each questions is worth 1 point". After, a StartButton prompt the user to open the second screen and begin the quiz . 
To display our messages , we used an array that we declared inside the main activity and add a code to our StartButton
Next  we have the second screen , we first declared two parrallel arrays (the questions and the answers). For each questions , the user has the choice to click whether  true or false and based on that , a feedback will be shown as "Correct" or "Incorrect" 
Here are the questions and the answers corresponding : "The first world war started in 1914 : True" "The second world war started in 1945: False" "Nelson Mandela was the first presidennt of South Africa: True" "Vlodymyr Zelenski is the current president of Ukraine: True" "Joe Biden was the last 2024 president of America: False"
After declaring our questions and variables , we wrote the code to prompt the user to answer the quiz. Using a for loop , the code is written as with  every questions , when the user click "True" or "False" , if the answer is right the feedback says "Correct" if not the feedback says "Incorrect"
Finally , a TerminateButton prompt the user to finish the quiz and open the last screen 
In the last screen , the user can review all the questions and right answers by clicking a ReviewButton . He can see his score by clicking the ScoreButton.Lastly he can exit the app if he wants by clicking the ExitButton
